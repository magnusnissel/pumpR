I’ve also been meaning to take a closer look at my collected workout logs for a while. The project is only a few days old and will hopefully develop into something bigger in due time. 1.1 Using and developing pumpR If you would like to use pumpR to visualize your own workout data or as a starting point to develop your own R-based workout reports, check out the GitHub repository for pumpR 1. I also welcome you to join me in developing pumpR. The code for pumpR is released under the Apache License 2.0 The name is derived from the german slang term for bodybuilder (Pumper) 2, which is related to the term “pump” describing the temporary increase in muscle size right after high-volume workouts. Remember: You will never be as big as your pump. 1.2 Features The following features are (at least partially) implemented Import of Fitocracy CSV files (only weight &amp; rep based activities) Import of FitNotes CSV files Rename exercises via CSV table Parse exercises for implement used (barbell, dumbbell etc.) and movement type (push, pull, etc.) List all workouts Some stastistics (e.g. number of workouts per year, total volume for each of the big four barbell lifts, etc.) 1.3 Planned features Normalize exercise names (develop and implement a semantic scheme for exercise naming) Parse for past and current personal records Annotate body parts (plus primary and secondary muscles involved) for each exercise More and more detailed tables and plots I have decided to include my personal workout logs in this repository to give you some sample data to play with↩ I just have to link the silly Rummelsnuff song here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKBDk6V8s2A↩ "]
