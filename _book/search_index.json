I have excluded cardio activities (e.g. indoor rowing, swimming) and there are a couple of untracked workouts missing from the data. 1.1 Workout frequency The first plot shows the total number of days on which I logged a workout, the other displays the monthly sum of sets to account for workout length. My most active year was cleary 2013, with 20+ workouts per month from March to July. However, these were generally shorter workouts with body part splits. I am not quite sure about the three-month break in 2014, but my least active period was from September 2015 to April 2016. I tried some CrossFit in December - which I did no bother logging - and switched gyms 2, but most of the absence was due work keeping me more busy than usual. Apparently I am really motivated in August. 1.2 The Big Four Squat Deadlift Bench Press Overhead Press 1.2.1 Traditional 3 1.2.2 With variations 4 1.3 Implements Note: Not all exercises have been assigned the correct implement, yet. 1.4 Movements Note: Not all exercises have been assigned the correct movement type, yet.
