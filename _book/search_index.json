I have excluded cardio activities (e.g. indoor rowing, swimming) and there are a couple of untracked workouts missing from the data. 1.1 Workout frequency The first plot shows the total number of days on which I logged a workout, the other displays the monthly sum of sets to account for workout length. My most active year was cleary 2013, with 20+ workouts per month from March to July. However, these were generally shorter workouts with body part splits. I am not quite sure about the three-month break in 2014, but my least active period was from September 2015 to April 2016. I tried some CrossFit in December - which I did no bother logging - and switched gyms 2, but most of the absence was due work keeping me more busy than usual and the flu. Apparently I am really motivated in August. 1.2 The big four As much as isolation exercises help for hypertrophy, there is a good reason that four compound lifts have a special status 3. squat deadlift bench press overhead press Below are some stats on these four lifts, both in the strict sense (counting only the classic barbell versions) and including all kinds of variants from machine hack squats to one-armed presses with extra thick dumbbells. I used to track via Fitocracy and now use FitNotes↩ My previous contract ended in January and the new gym opened in May↩ Feel free to argue that the Power Clean or Barbell Row should make the list, I’m siding with history on this one.↩ "]
